 icewm-toolbar - icewm toolbar configuration file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ICEWM_PRIVCFG/toolbar
 $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm/toolbar
 $HOME/.icewm/toolbar
 /etc/icewm/toolbar
 /usr/share/icewm/toolbar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<toolbar> file is responsible for configuring quick launch
application icons that are placed on the L<icewm(1)> panel.  It
contains names of quick to launch applications with icons for the task
bar.  Each non-empty non-comment line starts with the keyword B<prog>.
After one or more spaces follows a name, which is displayed in a tool
tip whenever the mouse cursor hovers over the toolbar icon.  This name
may be a double quoted string.  Then follows the bare name of the icon
to use without extensions.  This icon will be shown in the toolbar.  The
last component is a shell command line which will be executed whenever
the user presses the icon in the toolbar.  For example, the following
line in toolbar will create a button with tool tip C<Mozilla Firefox>
with the F<firefox> icon which launches L<firefox(1)> when clicked:

    prog  "Mozilla Firefox"  firefox  /usr/bin/firefox --private-window
